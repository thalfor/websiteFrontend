      <h1>Professional Experience</h1>
      <p>
        Here's a bit more about my professional experience!
        
        My professional experience began during my time at university, where I earned a bachelor's degree in Physics. 
        Initially, I intended to pursue a career as an academic professor focused on research, but I quickly realized that path wasn't the right fit for me. 
        I found myself wondering, "What should I do next?""
        That's when an opportunity came to join a "junior company", student-led organization in universities Brazil designed to help students gain practical, 
        real-world experience and prepare for the job market, beyond academia. This organization at the physics department was called "Quanta Jr.".

        At Quanta Jr., I played a lead role in creating the "Physics Show", where we demonstrated real experiments to schools. We even secured a government partnership, 
        which provided financial support for our performances. 
        Around the same time, I began working as a tutor, helping students prepare for university exams by teaching Physics and Math.

        I also worked as a english teacher when i moved from Campinas, where i was studying, to São Paulo for better jobs opportunities.

        At São Paulo i was researching areas that i could apply found what i need it, i set my mind to join the financial market!
        
        My first internship was at Boa Vista Serviços, now known as Equifax | Boa Vista, where I was responsible for creating credit score evaluations for companies, 
        helping them decide whether to extend more loans or recover money from defaulting clients.
        I used mainly SQL and SAS tools to do so.

        My second one was at Itaú Bank.
        At my internship there i worked again with data modeling but this time focused on improving the call center costumer experience.
        Again the main tools were SAS and SQL.

        After 6 months as an intern i was hired as a Junior Analyst but in Finance, they needed someone with a background in data manipulation and exact sciences.

        In finance, I worked on a project called '80x20.' Itaú had acquired another bank, BBA, and I was part of the lead team responsible 
        for merging the financial results and systems of both institutions. Our main objective was to present a unified report to the market, 
        combining the results of both banks.
        The main tools were MS Office, SAS, SQL.

        My next step was at Safra Bank, where I worked in both CRM and Finance. The main objective was to deliver specific projects based on the bank's needs.
        In CRM, I conducted performance analysis to determine whether the sales team was meeting the metrics approved by the bank's council.
        In Finance, my role was not only technical but i also got the Team Leader position where i had 3 employes under my management. 
        I developed results calculators for fixed-income investments that clients were purchasing. 
        The existing tools were outdated, both in terms of calculations and the software, as they were built in Excel and Access. I modernized them using SQL 
        and successfully deployed the new calculators into production.
        Later, I transitioned to a new role in the FP&A, Financial Planning & Analysis, department where i had a 2 employes team. Instead of working on the "backend",
        I focused on creating studies, cases, and analyses aimed at improving the bank's financial health. I leveraged the data generated 
        by my calculators to support this work.
        The main tools used here were Python, SQL, MS Office.

        After Safra Bank i took a year out to study and maybe find myself again as i did at the beginning of my career.
        In this year I did a JavaScript course at FreeCodeCamp and i loved it!! I had studied C at Uni however i didn't like it then.
        So i set my mind once again for a change, i will become a JavaScript developer.

        However i had to pay my rent and got back into finance before taking the next step. Life as it is I suppose.

        My most recent role in finance was at Pan Bank, where I was the specialist responsible for pricing loan portfolio transactions, 
        both buying and selling, from and to other banks. I set optimal prices based on our metrics for both buying and selling. 
        The main tools I used in this role were Python, AWS, SQL, and MS Office.

        Early 2024 i left the position to pursue this goal of working as a Javascript Developer, so I enroll at RocketSeat FullStack 
        course to find what i liked the most.
        Turns out it's Backend!
        Currently i'm getting a NodeJS specialization at RocketSeat.

        I hope you've enjoying the reading! Any questions feel free to contact me, i'll be happy to explain more.
