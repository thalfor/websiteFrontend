      <h1>Here's a bit more About Me</h1>
      <p>
        So fun fact, i don't really know how to write an About Me page but i was told to grab the reader's attention at the first seconds... so... 
        well... i'm colorblind!

        you see this? I dont =)

        Born in Brazil's countryside the one thing i always thought going to a big city like São Paulo to found a job a move on with my life 
        and i now that i'm here i kinda want to go back? hahaha the grass is always greener on the otherside i guess.

        Anyway let's start from the beginning of it all.. October 4th 1988.

        Born in the countryside has ups and downs, the same as everything in life i supose, the problem is that we almost never stop to see the good part
        and spend a lot of time chasing the dream, whatever that is.
        So you image me, a nerdy guy who likes to read, to play games, music in general, growing up in a city that had no book stores, like one place that
        sold gaming stuff, and very little access to different kinds of music. Marvelous.
        Talking like this you may think i hated there, well you're not entirely wrong, however i loved the people. Some at least.

        One of my first memories was a bithday party where the theme was RAMBO, oh yeah. I don't remember much of my childhood but i have this very specific 
        moment where i was crawling under my father's car at the garage and i really don't know why but that felt awesome! Why? well, RAMBO!!!

        I was born in Bauru and moved to another city when i was about 6 years old, the city is called Marília. Here i lived until i was 20 years old.
        At the time i was in Marília my passion for games and music bursted in me.
        I remember when i was introduced to Metallica! S&M album, it was something absolutely insane. This "new" music for me was what was going to define my
        hole personality during my young ages. Long hair and everything, really.

        See?

        With games was the same thing, i normaly say that i have two main core memories about gaming. Zelda Ocarina of Time and Pokemon Blue.
        <img src="" alt="" />
        This is how much i love these games.
        In Zelda OoT the feeling when you leave Kokiri Forest for the first time and you see the phenomenal huge map in front of you, honestly i can't describe the
        feeling.
        Pokemon was a bit different feeling, but i remember the first time i played was with an emulator and we shared games using floppy discs, oh yeah.
        The first time playing i remember when Squirtle learned Water Gun and a friend of mine said "bro, it's like 3 drops of water and you'll beat everything!", 
        AWESOME! Honestly it's awesome hahahhaa.
        Needless to say that this also shaped my hole personality along with Metallica.
